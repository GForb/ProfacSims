## Intro

Quatro doc Showing results of simulations run over my holiday. New addition was calcualtion of bias for beta covariates to investiage why we are seeing no impact on performance from random effects models when we introduce level 2 endogenity.

Simulaiton scenarios:


### Set up
Load libraries and connect to SQL database containing results.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(DBI)
library(RSQLite)
library(here)

# Connecting to database
db <- dbConnect(RSQLite::SQLite(), here("Results/Database/sim_results.db"))

```

## Simulation scenarios run
```{r}
dbGetQuery(db,
            "SELECT  DISTINCT n_studies, ICC, R2, study_sample_size_train , int_pred_corr
            FROM sim_results_v1
            WHERE sim_name = 'BatchAug2023'  AND metric = 'var_u'"
)
```
